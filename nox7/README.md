# CodeSupport Code Jam: 14 - 15 March 2020

This is my (nox7) entry for the CodeSupport code jam.

## Usage

This entry is a simple web application using WebGL 3D rendering to render a picturesque scene with a shape and text geometry render. Due to the fact it uses JavaScript modules, a web server must be used to get around the local system CORS policy. You can simply use XAMPP for this and then view the index.html file.

Do not attempt to view the index.html file without a web server - the web application will not work.

## When Viewing

Use your mouse to control the camera. Zoom, right-click, and left-click.
